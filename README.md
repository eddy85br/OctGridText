OctGridText
===========

Octave implamentation of an OCR pre-processor to find a grid in text pictures (Genetic Algorithm and fitness function).

The main idea is to find the lines that define a text line and the columns that separates letters in a picture taken from a text, like a book page, by using Genetic Algorithms.
A OCR implementation can use a grid made in this application to find characters and then try to match them.

This is a class exercise work of the Technology in Systems Development and Analysis undergraduation course at UFPR (Federal University of Paran√° State) - Brazil.
